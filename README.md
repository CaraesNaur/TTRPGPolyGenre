# Tabletop RPG Poly-Genre

Tabletop Role-playing games (RPGs) are currently classified into [genres](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/genre) mostly borrowed from fiction literature (novels and short stories in particular).  The RPG, as an interactive medium, demands a more sophisticated classification system.  Such a system would allow RPGs to be described in a clearer and more concise manner.

The goal of this system is twofold: Codify a universal terminology of genre for design/marketing purposes, and give players a vocabulary to describe the kind of games that they enjoy. The idea is to raise all ships.  Designers know who their audience is, publishers and sellers know how to market, and players know what they’re getting into.

## RPG Aspects

We propose a set of five aspects that combine to express the fundamental identity and features of any RPG.

### Setting

Setting refers to the environment imagined by players where their characters’ actions take place, or elements/conditions within the environment.

Examples:

* (Medieval) Fantasy
* Science fiction
* Post-apocalyptic
* Western
* (Alternative) Modern
* (Alternative) Historical: can be expressed as any era, e.g. classical Greece, Viking, maritime exploration
* Superheroes
* Dystopian
* Urban

*Alternative* denotes a setting based on Earth with significant deviations in history and/or politics.

*Medieval* denotes a pre-industrial era with mainly feudal politics.  The term typically assumes a Europe-like setting, however other regions/countries may be specified.

An RPG setting may be described by one or more terms.  Some terms are more mutually-exclusive than others, and not all hybrids make sense (such as "urban western").  Some of the examples given can be considered hybrids themselves; superheroes may be thought of as a form of "modern fantasy".

### Play Emphasis

*Play Emphasis* describes the type of character activities an RPG focuses on, as well as the balance among various activities.

Examples:

* Character-driven
* Cloak and dagger
* Combat
* Drama
* Dungeon crawling
* Exploration/travel
* Hack and slash
* Puzzle solving
* Sandbox/open-world
* Resource management

*Dungeon* is defined here as an enclosed area with limited entry points where the contents/conditions within are unknown to the characters.  Subterranean complexes, abandoned buildings, and derelict spaceships all qualify as dungeons.

Types of Play Emphasis can be considered a checklist/set of tags.

### Story Type

Story Type refers to the kind of narrative that the game expects to emerge during play.  Here, along with setting, is where literary genres are applicable.

Examples:

* Adventure
* Cataclysm
* Character personal growth
* Criminal enterprise
* Crime fighting
* Horror
* Journey/Travel
* Mystery/detective
* Politics
* Romance/erotica
* Redemption
* Revenge
* Social upheaval
* Suspense/Thriller

Politics is interactive dynamics between factions; including schoolyard cliques, corporations, and  political parties

### Mechanics

The Mechanics aspect addresses the nature of the game’s rules as well as the means by which players interact with them.

* Character assemblage: each player has one character at a time who collectively form a collaborative party (the de facto norm), [troupe system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troupe_system), faction heads (each character represents/leads an organization or region)
* Character Base: the mechanical basis of character role: class-based, skills-based
* Creative Ask: are players expected to use lists provided in the rules, or offer their own ideas ([showroom vs workshop](https://www.reddit.com/r/RPGdesign/comments/425sde/design_patterns_for_rpg_design/cz8fc5p/))
* Die Mechanic: a brief overview of the die mechanic used
* Heft/Crunch: complexity of the rules (light vs heavy)
* Imagination Landscape: grids-and-figurines vs theater-of-the-mind.
* Moderator: whether there a GM (the safe assumption is yes).  If so, what are the GM’s duties; if not, how do players moderate themselves.
* Speed: an aggregate of how much time is required to execute mechanics
* System Mastery: the level of rules expertise needed for a player to produce and play a viable character.
* Random Number Generator (RNG): the tool(s) used to resolve uncertainty in the fiction.  If omitted, dice are assumed.
* Reward System: how and for what the game allows characters to be improved

Mechanics are considered a checklist/set of tags.

### Binding

Binding describes the relationship between an RPG’s rules and the settings that can be paired with them.

* Universal: Any setting genre, any genre (GURPS, HERO, Genesys)
* Generic: Any setting within a particular setting genre (D&D)
* Bound: Rules and setting are tightly dependent on one another, packaged together, or otherwise considered parts of a whole.  All RPGs based on licensed intellectual property are integrated.

Each binding is mutually exclusive.

## Utilizing the Poly-Genre

It is strongly suggested that all five Aspects be included when describing an RPG, although Setting, Play Emphasis, and Mechanics are unavoidable.  The amount of Poly-Genre information used to describe a game is completely up to the user.

Designers and publishers can use Poly-Genre in several ways:

* Identifying design goals and target audience
* Developing the product brand
* Devising marketing strategies
* Writing promotional verbiage

Regarding marketing, it is expected that certain topics given in Poly-Genre will be downplayed or omitted in order to cast the product in the most positive light.

Promotional verbiage can refer to anything from ad copy, the "elevator pitch", or back cover blurbs.

Discussion among consumers, as well as editorial media, will likely include as much detail as possible when classifying an RPG in order to be complete and forthcoming.  The market will seek to clarify and correct a publisher’s claims about their product.
